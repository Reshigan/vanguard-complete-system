# Vanguard System Demo Guide

## Overview

This guide demonstrates the complete Vanguard Anti-Counterfeiting System workflow, including the counterfeit detection scenario with **Vanguard Reserve** whisky.

## Demo Scenario: Mark's Experience

### Background
Mark is at a local liquor store and wants to buy a bottle of **Vanguard Reserve**, a limited-edition whisky. The bottle looks authentic with correct labeling and an NXT Tag sticker on the neck.

### Step-by-Step Demo

#### 1. Initial Product Scan
**Mark opens the Vanguard mobile app and scans the NXT Tag sticker**

```
üîç Scanning NXT Tag Token...
Token Hash: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Token is authentic. Please tear the NXT Tag sticker to complete validation.",
  "token": {
    "productName": "Vanguard Reserve",
    "manufacturer": "Vanguard Distillery",
    "category": "Whisky",
    "alcoholContent": 43.0,
    "volume": 750,
    "batchNumber": "VG-240115-001",
    "productionDate": "2024-01-15",
    "expiryDate": "2034-01-15"
  },
  "requiresPhysicalValidation": true
}
```

#### 2. Physical Validation Attempt
**Mark tears the NXT Tag sticker to complete validation**

**Expected Result (Counterfeit Detection):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Token has already been validated. This may be a counterfeit product.",
  "isCounterfeit": true,
  "token": {
    "productName": "Vanguard Reserve",
    "manufacturer": "Vanguard Distillery",
    "validatedAt": "2024-08-01T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Counterfeit Reporting
**The app prompts Mark to report the counterfeit**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION: Token has been previously validated. 
This bottle may be counterfeit. Please report this location 
immediately to earn your rewards.
```

**Mark submits a report with:**
- Store location (GPS coordinates)
- Photos of the bottle and store aisle
- Description of the incident

#### 4. Manufacturer Alert
**On the Vanguard dashboard, the system immediately:**
- Logs Mark's report
- Flags the token ID as "invalidated"
- Identifies the duplicate validation attempt
- Dispatches investigation team
- Awards Mark 50 reward points

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. NXT Tag Not Working
- **Cause**: Browser doesn't support Web NXT Tag API
- **Solution**: Use manual token entry or test on Android Chrome

#### 2. Database Connection Error
- **Cause**: PostgreSQL not running or wrong credentials
- **Solution**: Check database status and .env configuration

#### 3. Token Validation Fails
- **Cause**: Token not found in database
- **Solution**: Ensure database is seeded with test data

#### 4. CORS Errors
- **Cause**: Frontend and backend on different ports
- **Solution**: Check CORS configuration in server/index.js

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check server logs
tail -f server/logs/combined.log

# Test database connection
cd server && npm run migrate

# Verify seed data
cd server && npm run seed

# Check API health
